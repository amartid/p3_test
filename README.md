# Vinyl Music Player
This is the code for the 3rd assignment on Advanced Software Engineering Course.
Aim of this project is to reduce the values of the metrics on vulnerable classes of the code.
This was achieved through changes on the code by performing refactoring on problematic methods. These Methods were detected by Smellsdetector. Analysis was made by executing MetricsCalculator for every change and by using Microsoft Excel to edit the outcome data. 
**Forked from [Vinyl Music Player]
